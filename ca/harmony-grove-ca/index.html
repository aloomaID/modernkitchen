            <h3>Harmony Grove, CA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Harmony Grove Church is a rare surviving example of an early Protestant brick church in California's Central Valley. The single-story brick building originally had a flat roof, and was built in Greek Revival style in 1859. A brick pediment was added in 1868, contributing to a Gothic appearance. The 1868 remodeling also raised the roof by 9 feet and replaced the tarpaper with wood shingles.</p>
